# Biography Profile in Plain HTML
This project is a simple HTML file that contains my biography profile. The goal is to present my personal and professional information using only basic HTML elements, without any styling, CSS, or additional libraries.

# Purpose
Practice HTML: To reinforce my understanding of HTML by structuring content semantically.
Focus on Content: To emphasize the importance of content organization before applying any design elements.
Baseline for Styling: To create a foundation that can later be enhanced with styling and interactivity.

# What's Included
Headings and Subheadings: Organizing sections like Introduction, Education, Work Experience, Skills, and Interests.
Paragraphs and Lists: Presenting information in a clear and readable format.
Semantic Tags: Utilizing tags like <header>, <main>, <section>, and <footer> for better HTML semantics.

# How to View the Profile
Clone or Download: Get a copy of this repository onto your local machine.
Open the HTML File: Navigate to the project folder and open index.html in any web browser.
No Setup Required: Since there is no styling or scripting, the profile should display as plain text with basic HTML structure.

# Future Plans
Add Styling: Introduce CSS to enhance the visual appeal.
Make Responsive: Ensure the profile looks good on all device sizes.
Include Multimedia: Add images, links, and possibly videos to enrich the content.
